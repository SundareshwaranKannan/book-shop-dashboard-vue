# book-management-dashboard

The book shop dashboard project is the code base for the user interface of a simple book bank application. In this project I worked around the basics of Vue.js and tried to implement the few topics to put them into action.
The backend code for all the API's are available in my other repo: https://github.com/SundareshwaranKannan/book-shop-service
